<h3> Product Description </h3>
  <p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Switch is a new game console that is being developed by Nintendo. The main distinction between it and any other gaming console on the market is that it can play video games on television screens and seemlessly transition to a tablet by simply removing the tablet from the console dock. This means that you can play console quality games on the go. The video game controller are called joy-cons and are the two seperate neon controllers that you can see in the image above being taken off the tablet. These controllers can be used together or seperatly by more than one player in multiplayer games. This console is similar to the past Nintendo console, the Wii U, as it also had a screen attached affixed to the controller, but what sets the Switch apart is the true ability to become untethered to the stationary part of the console.

<h3> Why My I Lost My Breath </h3>
  <p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I will not have the pleasure of using the Nintendo Switch until its release, on March 3rd, it has taken my breath away nontheless. From the footage that I have not been able to take my eyes off I have see the device seemlessly transform from a stationary video game console to a portable one seemelessly. As an avid gamer who prefers to be on the go this concept resonates with me and has captivated me more than any other peice of technology in a long time. The idea of a controller that can be afixed to the sides of the console or taken off and used by more than one player makes me excited for all the fun cooperative experiences.
